SIT323 Cloud Application Development, Assignment Task 1- Validation &amp; Testing

This Assessment Task focuses on designing, developing and testing a new program such that it is able to:
• Validate/invalidate the two data files related to configuration and task allocations. • Validate/invalidate allocations that are described in the 
  allocations file.
• Compute and display the amount of energy consumed by each allocation.
• Display each allocation.


1. Design and develop a new program to work with the two input data files. Their formats are described in the following sections:
• Task Allocation file format (.taff)
• Configuration file format (.cff)
2. Design and develop many unit tests.
3. Code to conventions and standards.


# Validating files and allocation
1. Your software solution for Assessment Task 1 must be able to validate both text input data files (taff and cff).
Invalid aspects of these files are displayed to a user via the GUI.
2. Your software solution for Assessment Task 1 must be able to validate allocations too, but only if both input data files are valid. 
Consequently, it is possible to have perfectly valid input files, but an allocation is invalid.


To help you design and develop your unit tests and software, you will be provided with several pairs of CFF and TAFF files based on the above formats. 
These files can be found in the ZIP file called Assessment Task 1 – Data Files.zip.
